<h3>Activities</h3>

<div class="card-body">
    <p>
        When im not tapping away on the keyboard, i try to stay active. I practice Kendo, which is a Japanese fencing sport.
        I go to the gym 3 times a week, usually in the mornings before work. Im also currently learning to hang glide,
        which is awsome!

        However, once all the active stuff is done, im always coming back to the keyboard and playing around with the
        Laravel and Vue frameworks. I love unwinding by just sitting back, and watching YouTube to see how others solve
        certain programming challenges, and any tips or tricks i can pickup from them.
