    I have been working in technology industries for 19 years now. I started out with a small company stripping down and
    rebuilding old PC, to recycle and sell on to devloping countries. I then went on to work for a telecoms company,
    maintaining and installing telephones system, and also provided internal IT support. From there,  i worked for another
    IT consultancy company as an IT consultant, looking after several clients in the South East. I provided all manor of
    support from desktops, laptops, server, printers, WiFi and software. Now I work for a medium sized telecoms company,
    where i provided all the internal IT support and administration, before moving over to my current role, as a web developer
    where i build and maintain the company's CRMs and websites.
