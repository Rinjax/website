    <span class="badge badge-success" style="font-size: 1rem">Full Stack Developer</span> - well... i would say im probably
    the most 'full stack' you can get. Not only can i develop front end and back end code, i can manage the servers, services and
    networks it runs on. Making sure they're monitored for uptime, monitor resources, and make sure that there's data backups
    and fail over plans in place. That's a complete end to end skill set for web development.

    I have been working in technology industries for 19 years now. I started out with a small company stripping down and
    rebuilding old PC, to recycle and sell on to developing countries. I then went on to work for a telecoms company,
    maintaining and installing telephones system, and also provided internal IT support. From there,  i worked for an
    IT consultancy company, looking after several clients in the South East. I provided all manor of
    support from desktops, laptops, server, printers, WiFi and software. Now I work for a medium sized telecoms company,
    where i provided all the internal IT support and administration, before moving over to my current role, as a web developer
    where i build and maintain the company's CRMs and websites.

    I always really enjoyed the scripting side when doing server and desktop administration. I would always get the feeling
    of glee seeing the script run through and 'Bang' several servers configured and 100's of desktops PC configured. That's
    where i started getting a taste for programming. When the opportunity rose to make the change from Systems Administrator
    to Developer, i jumped in without hesitation and haven't looked back. I can't believe i hadn't made the change sooner!

    With background knowledge in programming already (from scripting with the servers), it didnt take me long to pickup
    PHP and the Laravel framework. I played around in my space time, read the documentations, Googled things, and, of course
    there's stack overflow.
