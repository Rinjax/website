    Well, I would say im probably the most 'full stack' you can get. Not only can I develop front end and back end code,
    I can manage the servers, services and networks it runs on. Making sure they're monitored for uptime, monitor resources,
    and make sure that there's data backups and fail over plans in place. That's a complete end to end skill set for web
    development.

    I have been working in technology industries for {!! \Carbon\Carbon::create(2000,07,01)->diffInYears(\Carbon\Carbon::now()) !!}
    years now. I started out with a small company stripping down and rebuilding old PCs, to recycle and sell on to developing
    countries. I then went on to work for a telecoms company, maintaining and installing telephones system, and also provided
    internal IT support. From there,  I worked for an IT consultancy company, looking after several clients in the South East.
    I provided all manor of support from desktops, laptops, server, printers, WiFi and software. Now I work for a medium sized
    telecoms company, where I provided all the internal IT support and administration, before moving over to my current role,
    as a web developer where I build and maintain the company's CRMs and websites. This has given me the opportunity to work
    with APIs from TalkTalk, Sage, Aurora Billing and NetLynk, as well as, building our own APIs for our partners to interact
    with our systems.

    I always really enjoyed the scripting side when doing server and desktop administration. I would always get the feeling
    of glee seeing the script run through and 'bang!' several servers configured and 100's of desktops PC configured. That's
    where I started getting a taste for programming. When the opportunity rose to make the change from Systems Administrator
    to Developer, I jumped in without hesitation and haven't looked back. I can't believe I hadn't made the change sooner!

    With background knowledge in programming already (from scripting with the servers), it didnt take me long to pickup
    PHP and the Laravel framework. I played around in my space time, read the documentations, Googled things, and, of course
    there's stack overflow, which usually has an answer for every error you come across. From there i realised that there
    must be more modern ways for developing the front end, which is where i started learning VueJS. This lead on to Vue
    extension frameworks like VueX and NuxtJS, and even other frameworks for backend services like GraphQL.

    I known im not the most highly educated person you'll meet, but I sure do love learning new things that interest me, and
    will happily dedicate my spare time researching things I dont know. Im not one to shy a way from a challenge just because
    I dont know how to do it. I can get a little OCD with a problem, and have a need to be able resolve, or at very least
    understand why there is a problem.
